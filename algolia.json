They enhance code readability and maintainability by allowing you to write more compact and expressive code for functional programming constructs. Lambdas also facilitate the use of functional interfaces in the Java API, making it easier to work with collections and streams. Overall, they contribute to more efficient and modern Java programming practices.","tags":null,"title":"Java Lambda: All you need to know to code","type":"post","url":"/post/2024-01-09-java-lambda-1/","weight":0,"wordcount":1605},{"author":null,"categories":null,"content":null,"date":-62135596800,"description":"","dir":"about/","excerpt_html":null,"excerpt_text":null,"expirydate":-62135596800,"fuzzywordcount":600,"html":null,"keywords":null,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"8576ec274c98b3831668a172fa632d80","permalink":"https://bawadev.github.io/about/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","readingtime":1,"relpermalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"About Me Huabing Zhao is a software architect, an Istio Member and an ONAP PTL.
